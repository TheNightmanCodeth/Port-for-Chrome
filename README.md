Port Chrome Extension
================================
Hey!
How did you get here?

This repo is supposed to be private):

If you can see this, this was a 
chrome extension for sending strings
to and from a smartphone using
firebase. It has been abandoned. I'm 
working on a new version that will be 
a whole lot better. Stay tuned, I 
guess? But it's not like anybody will 
read this.
